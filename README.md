# Battleship-JS
Review and improvement of an existing GitHub project. It is a simple battleship game done with HTML, CSS and JS. 
I improved the CSS and the JS, although it isn't finished yet. Comments in uppercase describe what I did. 

The original project, by LearningNerd, can be found here: https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/Battleship-JavaScript
